AWS regions - A region is a cluster of data centres, AWS has regions all around the world.

How to choose an AWS Region?
Compliance with data governance and legal requirements 
Availability for services, certain services aren't available in every region
Proximity to customers faster response times and reduced latemcy
Pricing, the pricing varies region to region

AWS Availability Zones(AZs) 
<br> Each region is made up of multiple az's (usually 3-6 zones) which are data centres. They're separated from each other so they're isolated from disasters and the others can keep running.
<br> Even though the az's are physically separated they're connected with high bandwidth and low latency networking so they communicate fast with each other.
<br> AZ's give you that extra layer of protection and reliability while keeping everything connected and smooth.

Points of Presence(Edge Locations) 
Content is delivered to end users with lower latency, amazon has 400+ edge locations in 90+ cites across 40+ countries. The closer an edge location is to your end user the faster aws can deliver your content.
